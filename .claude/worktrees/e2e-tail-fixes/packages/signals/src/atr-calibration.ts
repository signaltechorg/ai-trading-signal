/**
 * Per-symbol ATR stop calibration.
 *
 * Gold, BTC, EURUSD all have wildly different volatility profiles — applying a
 * single ATR multiplier to every instrument leads to premature stop-outs on
 * volatile assets and loose stops on quiet ones. This module takes the recorded
 * outcome history for a single symbol and grid-searches candidate ATR
 * multipliers, scoring each by how many recorded stop-outs it would have
 * avoided minus how many wins it would have flipped to losses.
 *
 * Pure function. No I/O. Caller is responsible for supplying per-symbol samples
 * and persisting/caching the result.
