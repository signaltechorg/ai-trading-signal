TradeClaw generates BUY/SELL signals using multi-timeframe technical analysis (RSI, MACD, EMA, Bollinger Bands, Stochastic, Supertrend). Every signal is recorded in a Postgres database and published on the [track record](https://tradeclaw.win/track-record) — wins **and** losses, no cherry-picking.

## Self-hosting vs. TradeClaw Pro (hosted)

TradeClaw is MIT-licensed. You can fork, self-host, and run the entire signal framework for free — the free-tier signal engine (classic TA, RSI + EMA + MACD confluence), backtester, dashboard, paper trading, and public Telegram broadcaster are all in this repo.

The hosted version at **tradeclaw.win** adds features that activate only when the deploy holds the matching credentials:

| Feature | Unlocked by env var | Who has it |
|---|---|---|
| Real-time premium signals (MTF confluence, curated) | `PREMIUM_SIGNAL_SOURCE_URL` + `PREMIUM_SIGNAL_SOURCE_KEY` | tradeclaw.win only |
| Stripe checkout + tier upgrade on webhook | `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Per-deploy |
| Private Pro Telegram group + invite on subscribe | `TELEGRAM_PRO_GROUP_ID` + Pro bot token | tradeclaw.win only |
| Telegram auto-broadcast of free symbols | `TELEGRAM_CHANNEL_ID` + bot token | Per-deploy |

Without these, self-hosters get the free-tier experience — which is the same signal engine the founders trade against real capital. **No code is withheld.** What is withheld is the curated premium signal feed and the payment plumbing. Those are operational, not algorithmic.

If you want to run your own paid tier on top of this code: set your own Stripe keys, run your own premium signal generator, and point `PREMIUM_SIGNAL_SOURCE_URL` at it. The HTTP contract is minimal — `GET <url>` returning `{ signals: TradingSignal[] }` with a Bearer `Authorization` header using `PREMIUM_SIGNAL_SOURCE_KEY`. Returns `[]` (and the hosted deploy keeps working with the DB-backed `premium_signals` table) if the remote is down.

## Self-host

### One-liner (no clone required)

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 ghcr.io/naimkatiman/tradeclaw:latest
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) — you'll get the
dashboard with the bundled SQLite fallback so you can try it instantly.
For persistent storage and the full feature set, point `DATABASE_URL`
at a PostgreSQL instance:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 \
  -e DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@host:5432/tradeclaw \
  ghcr.io/naimkatiman/tradeclaw:latest
```

### Docker Compose (recommended for production)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/naimkatiman/tradeclaw
cd tradeclaw
cp .env.example .env   # edit DATABASE_URL + Telegram tokens
docker compose up -d   # or: docker-compose up -d on the legacy CLI
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Requires PostgreSQL. Run migrations from `apps/web/migrations/` in order.

### Image tags

| Tag | What it tracks |
| --- | --- |
| `ghcr.io/naimkatiman/tradeclaw:latest` | Latest push to `main` (auto-built) |
| `ghcr.io/naimkatiman/tradeclaw:edge` | Same as `latest` — short-lived testing tag |
| `ghcr.io/naimkatiman/tradeclaw:vX.Y.Z` | A specific release tag |
| `ghcr.io/naimkatiman/tradeclaw:sha-<git-sha>` | A specific commit |

## Architecture

```
apps/web/                       Next.js app (dashboard, API routes, signal engine)
apps/web/lib/execution/         Broker bridges (Binance USDT-perp, RoboForex R StocksTrader)
packages/strategies/            Backtest comparison framework (not in live signal path)
scripts/launch-binance-testnet.sh   Binance testnet bootstrap
```

**Signal flow:**

```
API request → getTrackedSignals() → generateSignalsFromTA()
  → ta-engine.ts (RSI, MACD, EMA, BB, Stoch, Supertrend)
  → recordSignalsAsync() → signal_history table
  → /track-record page
```

Signals are generated as a side effect of API requests — no external scheduler. The TA engine runs inside the Next.js process.

**Market data:**

```
/api/prices, OHLCV, SSE
  → market-data-hub (primary, MARKET_DATA_HUB_URL)
  → Binance (crypto fallback)
  → Yahoo Finance (everything else fallback)
```

The hub is the source of truth. The two fallbacks are thin survival paths — they kick in only if the hub returns empty or errors, and OHLCV results from fallbacks are not cached so a hub blip can't lock the dashboard into stale synthetic data.

**Execution (Pro):**

```
Pro signal → apps/web/lib/execution/executor.ts
  → Binance USDT-perp (testnet by default) | RoboForex R StocksTrader
  → pg advisory lock (single client across full execution path)
  → kill-switch fail-closed if any precondition missing
```

Order placement maps the TradeClaw pair (`BTC/USD`) to the broker contract (`BTCUSDT` perp) before submission. Bootstrap a Binance testnet account with `bash scripts/launch-binance-testnet.sh`.

## Strategy Presets

Five entry strategies, switchable via `SIGNAL_ENGINE_PRESET`:

| Preset | Logic |
|--------|-------|
| `classic` | RSI + MACD + EMA scoring — no regime filter |
| `regime-aware` | Classic filtered by HMM regime |
| `hmm-top3` | Regime-aware, top 3 by confidence — **production default** |
| `vwap-ema-bb` | Mean-reversion at BB extremes with VWAP + EMA |
| `full-risk` | HMM top-3 with risk-weighted allocation |

Compare presets in the [backtest UI](https://tradeclaw.win/backtest) with side-by-side metrics and equity curves.

## API
