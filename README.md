AI Trading Signal generates BUY/SELL signals using multi-timeframe technical analysis (RSI, MACD, EMA, Bollinger Bands, Stochastic, ADX, Volume). Every signal is recorded in a Postgres database and published on the track record — wins **and** losses, no cherry-picking.

> **Stack:** TypeScript monorepo (Next.js, Fastify ws-server, Redis via `ioredis-os`, PostgreSQL). No Python runtime required.

> Status: pre-1.0 (`0.1.0`). The signal engine, dashboard, backtester, and self-host path are usable today; APIs and schema may still change between releases.

## Self-hosting

AI Trading Signal is MIT-licensed. You can fork, self-host, and run the entire signal framework for free — the free-tier signal engine (classic TA, RSI + EMA + MACD confluence), backtester, dashboard, paper trading, and public Telegram broadcaster are all in this repo.

The hosted version at **tradeclaw.win** adds features that activate only when the deploy holds the matching credentials:

| Feature | Unlocked by env var | Who has it |
|---|---|---|
| Real-time premium signals (MTF confluence, curated) | `PREMIUM_SIGNAL_SOURCE_URL` + `PREMIUM_SIGNAL_SOURCE_KEY` | tradeclaw.win only |
| Stripe checkout + tier upgrade on webhook | `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Per-deploy |
| Private Pro Telegram group + invite on subscribe | `TELEGRAM_PRO_GROUP_ID` + Pro bot token | tradeclaw.win only |
| Telegram auto-broadcast of free symbols | `TELEGRAM_CHANNEL_ID` + bot token | Per-deploy |

Without these, self-hosters get the free-tier experience — which is the same signal engine the founders trade against real capital. **No code is withheld.** What is withheld is the curated premium signal feed and the payment plumbing. Those are operational, not algorithmic.

If you want to run your own paid tier on top of this code: set your own Stripe keys, run your own premium signal generator, and point `PREMIUM_SIGNAL_SOURCE_URL` at it. The HTTP contract is minimal — `GET <url>` returning `{ signals: TradingSignal[] }` with a Bearer `Authorization` header using `PREMIUM_SIGNAL_SOURCE_KEY`. Returns `[]` (and the hosted deploy keeps working with the DB-backed `premium_signals` table) if the remote is down.

## Quick start (Docker)

### One-liner (no clone required)

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 ghcr.io/naimkatiman/tradeclaw:latest
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) — the dashboard loads, but the web app requires a PostgreSQL `DATABASE_URL` and throws on first DB access if it is unset. There is no bundled SQLite fallback. Point `DATABASE_URL` at a PostgreSQL instance:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 \
  -e DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@host:5432/tradeclaw \
  ghcr.io/naimkatiman/tradeclaw:latest
```

### Docker Compose (recommended for production)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/signaltechorg/ai-trading-signal.git
cd ai-trading-signal
cp .env.example .env   # edit DATABASE_URL + Telegram tokens
docker compose up -d   # or: docker-compose up -d on the legacy CLI
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Requires PostgreSQL. Migrations live in `apps/web/migrations/` and should be applied in filename order against your `DATABASE_URL`.

### Image tags

| Tag | What it tracks |
| --- | --- |
| `ghcr.io/naimkatiman/tradeclaw:latest` | Latest push to `main` (auto-built) |
| `ghcr.io/naimkatiman/tradeclaw:edge` | Same as `latest` — short-lived testing tag |
| `ghcr.io/naimkatiman/tradeclaw:vX.Y.Z` | A specific release tag |
| `ghcr.io/naimkatiman/tradeclaw:sha-<git-sha>` | A specific commit |

## Monitoring (Grafana + Prometheus)

TradeClaw exposes a Prometheus-compatible metrics endpoint at `/api/metrics` (signal direction, confidence, RSI, counts, freshness, outcomes). An opt-in monitoring stack ships with the compose file:

```bash
docker compose --profile monitoring up -d   # adds prometheus (:9090) + grafana (:3001)
```

Then open Grafana at [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) (default login `admin`/`admin`, override with `GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD`), add Prometheus (`http://prometheus:9090`) as a data source, and import `grafana/tradeclaw-dashboard.json`. The default `docker compose up` does not start these services. See [`grafana/README.md`](grafana/README.md) for the metrics reference and panel details.

## Local development (from source)

AI Trading Signal is a TypeScript npm-workspaces monorepo. You need Node.js 20+, npm, and a PostgreSQL instance. The web app requires `DATABASE_URL` and throws on first DB access if it is unset — there is no bundled SQLite fallback.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/signaltechorg/ai-trading-signal.git
cd ai-trading-signal
npm install            # installs all workspaces
cp .env.example .env   # set DATABASE_URL and any optional tokens

npm run dev            # start the Next.js web app (apps/web) on :3000
```

Common workspace scripts (all defined in the root `package.json`):

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Run the web app (`apps/web`) in dev mode |
| `npm run build` | Build `packages/signals`, then `apps/web` |
| `npm run build:all` | Build `signals` + `agent` + web + ws-server |
| `npm run start` | Start the built web app |
| `npm run lint` | Lint `apps/web` |
| `npm run typecheck` | Type-check all TypeScript workspaces |
| `npm test` | Run the Jest unit suite |
| `npm run test:e2e` | Run the Playwright e2e suite (`apps/web`) |
| `npm run ws:dev` / `ws:build` / `ws:start` / `ws:test` | Develop, build, run, or test the websocket server (`apps/ws-server`) |
| `npm run agent` | Run the trading-agent CLI (`packages/agent`) |
| `npm run agent:start` / `agent:scan` / `agent:server` | Start the agent loop, run a one-off scan, or run the agent HTTP server |
| `npm run resolve:outcomes` | Resolve real outcomes for recorded signals |

The Expo/React Native client in `apps/mobile` has its own `package.json` and is run with the Expo CLI from inside that workspace.

```

> Note: the standalone `tradeclaw-discord` bot package (issue #38) remains early scaffolding. The web app's Discord webhook integration, however, is shipped and wired: when `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` is set, the `/api/cron/telegram` broadcast job posts the same free-tier signals to a Discord channel (deduped via `discord_posted_at`), and per-user alert rules can target a Discord webhook channel.

## How it works

**Signal flow:**

```
API request → getTrackedSignals() → generateSignalsFromTA()
  → ta-engine.ts (RSI, MACD, EMA, BB, Stoch, ADX, Volume)
  → recordSignalsAsync() → signal_history table
  → /track-record page
```

Signals are generated as a side effect of API requests — no external scheduler. The TA engine runs inside the Next.js process.

**Market data:**

```
/api/prices, OHLCV, SSE
  → market-data-hub (primary, MARKET_DATA_HUB_URL)
  → Binance (crypto fallback)
  → Stooq CSV (forex/metals fallback)
  → static last-known-good / synthetic (ultimate safety net)
```

The hub is the source of truth. The two fallbacks are thin survival paths — they kick in only if the hub returns empty or errors, and OHLCV results from fallbacks are not cached so a hub blip can't lock the dashboard into stale synthetic data.

**Execution (Pro):**

```
Pro signal → apps/web/lib/execution/executor.ts
  → Binance USDT-perp (testnet by default); RoboForex R StocksTrader bridge scaffolded (interface only, not implemented)
  → pg advisory lock (single client across full execution path)
  → kill-switch fail-closed if any precondition missing
```

Order placement maps the TradeClaw pair (`BTC/USD`) to the broker contract (`BTCUSDT` perp) before submission. Bootstrap a Binance testnet account with `bash scripts/launch-binance-testnet.sh`.

## Strategy presets

Five entry strategies, comparable side-by-side in the backtest UI. In live signal generation, `SIGNAL_ENGINE_PRESET` (default `hmm-top3`) currently selects the preset only as a label on emitted signals — the live engine still generates with the `classic` profile regardless of preset. Per-preset live generation is not yet wired:

| Preset | Logic |
|--------|-------|
| `classic` | RSI + MACD + EMA scoring — no regime filter |
| `regime-aware` | Classic filtered by HMM regime (backtest only; live signal path currently runs the `classic` profile) |
| `hmm-top3` | Regime-aware, top 3 by confidence — **production default** (the wired default for the executor and signal cron; live regime filtering applies in the backtest engine) |
| `vwap-ema-bb` | Mean-reversion at BB extremes with VWAP + EMA |
| `full-risk` | HMM top-3 with risk-weighted allocation |

Compare presets in the [backtest UI](https://tradeclaw.win/backtest) with side-by-side metrics and equity curves.

## API

```bash
# Get current signals (free tier — 6 symbols, 30-min delay, 7-day history)
curl https://tradeclaw.win/api/signals

# Get track record stats
curl https://tradeclaw.win/api/strategy-breakdown
```

Pro subscribers get real-time access to all endpoints with full depth.

## Notifications

TradeClaw can push signals over multiple channels, each enabled by env vars:

- **Telegram** — instant per-signal alerts (`TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` + channel IDs).
- **Email** — instant per-signal alerts and a daily digest. Pick a provider with `EMAIL_PROVIDER`:
  - `resend` (default) — `RESEND_API_KEY` + `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL`
  - `sendgrid` — `SENDGRID_API_KEY`
  - `smtp` — `SMTP_HOST` / `SMTP_PORT` / `SMTP_USER` / `SMTP_PASS` (requires `npm install nodemailer`)
- **Daily digest email** — set `EMAIL_TO` (comma-separated) and the `/api/cron/daily-digest` job emails the day's top signals via the configured provider, independently of Telegram.
- **Webhooks** — see the [webhook integration guide](docs/webhooks.md) for the signal payload schema and polling/cron patterns, plus ready-to-run forwarders in [`examples/webhooks/`](examples/webhooks/) (Slack, Discord, n8n, Zapier, Google Sheets).

See `.env.example` for the full list of notification env vars.
