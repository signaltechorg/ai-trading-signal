 * Generate a static snapshot of the OpenAPI spec into public/openapi.json.

 * Run manually via:
 *   npx tsx apps/web/scripts/generate-openapi.ts
 *
 * The snapshot is also served dynamically by GET /api/openapi.json, so this
 * file is optional — it exists so the spec is directly fetchable as a static
 * asset (CDN-friendly) and so spec changes are visible in PR diffs.
