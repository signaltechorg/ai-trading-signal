/**
 * Pro-broadcast gate decision, computed BEFORE persistence (engine-makeover
 * Phase 1). One pipeline run per cron tick decides, per signal: does this row
 * reach the Pro broadcast, and why not if it doesn't. The cron records the
 * decision on the row (migration 048) so the broadcast-filtered subset is
 * measurable — previously the decision was computed after recording and only
 * console-warned.
 *
 * Decision semantics:
 * - winning-cells curation (when active) blocks deterministically.
 * - risk pipeline (circuit breakers → allocator → veto) blocks with a reason.
 * - pipeline OUTAGE falls back to unfiltered broadcast (Pro must not silently
 *   mute) — those rows are marked `recordable: false` and their decision is
 *   NOT persisted: the gate never actually ran, so NULL ("decision not
 *   recorded") is the truthful state even though the row was broadcast.
