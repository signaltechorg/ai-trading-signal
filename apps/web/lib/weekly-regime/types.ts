/**
 * Weekly Regime Card — Layer 1 directional-bias engine.
 *
 * SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for the regime model. Do not improvise variants of
 * these enums elsewhere — import from here.
 *
 * Every Monday an admin sets a directional bias per asset class. The system
 * derives a TRENDING / NEUTRAL classification per class and persists a
 * machine-readable card the Telegram bot and Layer-2 consume for the week.
 *
 * DISTINCT from the algorithmic per-symbol `market_regimes` table and
 * `regime-filter.ts` (bull/bear/neutral...). That system is computed from
 * price action per symbol. THIS system is human-set, per-asset-class, weekly.
 * Keep the two conceptually and namewise separate.
 *
 * This file is intentionally free of `server-only` and DB imports so the
 * admin client component can import {@link classifyRegime} for live preview.
