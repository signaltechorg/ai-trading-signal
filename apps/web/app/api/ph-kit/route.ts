    firstComment: `Hey Product Hunt! 👋\n\nI built TradeClaw because I was tired of paying $50+/mo for trading signal services that I couldn't customize or self-host.\n\nTradeClaw is 100% open-source and runs on your own infra with a single \`docker compose up\`. It analyzes BTC, ETH, XAU, EUR, GBP and more using EMA, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, and Stochastic oscillators.\n\nWhat makes it different:\n- Self-hosted — your data stays yours\n- Live signals every 5 minutes with confidence scores\n- Paper trading mode to test before risking real money\n- Embeddable widgets for blogs and dashboards\n- REST API + Telegram bot integration\n\nWould love your feedback. Star us on GitHub if you find it useful!`,
