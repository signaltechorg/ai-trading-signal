# TradeClaw Roadmap: Q2 2026 - Q4 2027

> **Goal:** Go from "cool open-source demo" to "users pay for premium signals" in 18 months.
> **North Star Metric:** Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) from premium signal subscribers.

---

## Current State (June 2026)

**What exists:**
- 30+ symbol coverage (crypto, forex, metals) with 7 real TA indicators
- 320+ page Next.js dashboard (signals, backtest, paper trading, leaderboard, operator console)
- Docker Compose self-host + Vercel live demo at tradeclaw.win
- Telegram + Discord bot infrastructure + premium channel gating
- Stripe billing with Pro ($29/mo) + Elite ($99/mo) checkout + 7-day trial
- WebSocket + SSE live price streaming
- OG images, badges, API docs, RSS/Atom feeds
- Automated outcome tracker — TP/SL/expired resolution runs hourly (564/573 signals resolved)
- Rolling 7d/30d/90d win-rate snapshots on /track-record
- TradingView webhook receiver mirroring premium signals into history
- Free-tier 30-min delayed signal preview + full paywall gating
- API key tier rate limits (Free 10/hr, Pro 100/hr, Elite unlimited)
- Referral revenue tracking (20% share on Stripe payments)
- Compliance pages (Terms, Privacy)

**What's broken / missing:**
- Win rate is ~40% (positive expectancy +0.10R) but below the original 60% target — engine quality still improving
- No TradingView profile integration to publish track record externally
- No mobile app (Expo) for push notifications
- No multi-provider signal marketplace (other traders publishing signals)
- No live copy-trading (auto-execute on connected broker accounts)
- Free users lack persistent server-side portfolios (localStorage only)

## Premium Signal Monetization Strategy (Zaky's Personal Signals)

### The Asset
Zaky's TradingView strategies (EMA21 + VWAP + RSI + Supertrend) across 3 timeframes:
- **Scalper** (1m-5m) — quick trades, London/NY sessions
- **Intraday** (5m-15m) — 1-4 hour holds
- **Swing** (4H/Daily) — multi-day positions

Currently running on XAUUSD via the `trading-strategies` Telegram bot (Cloudflare Worker + AI chart analysis).

### Monetization Path

```
Step 1: PROVE IT (Apr-Jul 2026)
├── Connect TV alerts → TradeClaw webhook receiver
├── Track every signal outcome automatically
├── Build 3-month verified track record
└── Publish results publicly on /track-record

Step 2: GATE IT (Aug-Sep 2026)
├── Premium signals = real-time, Free = 30min delay
├── Stripe paywall: $29/mo Pro, $99/mo Elite
├── Premium Telegram channel for subscribers
└── 7-day free trial to hook users

Step 3: SCALE IT (Oct 2026+)
├── Shareable trade cards for social media
├── Affiliate program (20% rev share)
├── Content: weekly recaps, strategy breakdowns
├── Expand from XAUUSD to all 30 symbols
└── Mobile push notifications

Step 4: PLATFORM IT (2027)
├── Other traders publish signals (marketplace)
├── Copy trading (auto-execute via broker)
├── TradeClaw takes 30% of marketplace revenue
└── Institutional tier for prop desks
```

### Key Principle
> **Track record is the product.** Nobody pays for signals without proof.
> Build 3 months of verified results before turning on the paywall.

## Immediate Next Actions (This Week)

1. **Signal engine quality pass** — tighten entry filters to push win rate from ~40% toward 50%+
2. **TradingView profile integration** — publish verified track record to TV profile
3. **Mobile app MVP (Expo)** — push notifications for premium signals
4. **Multi-provider signal marketplace scaffold** — allow other traders to publish signals

## Risk Register

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Low win rate destroys credibility | Fatal | Don't launch paywall until 60%+ win rate proven over 3 months |
| Regulatory issues (financial advice) | High | Always disclaim "not financial advice", no guaranteed returns |
| TradingView API changes | Medium | Abstract webhook format, support multiple alert formats |
| Stripe account restrictions (trading) | Medium | Use Stripe Atlas or Paddle as backup payment processor |
| GitHub DMCA / competitor clones | Low | Move fast, build community moat, premium = Zaky's edge |
| Signal latency (delayed alerts) | Medium | WebSocket + push notifications, monitor alert delivery time |
