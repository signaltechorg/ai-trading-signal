- [ ] Clone your forks locally
- [ ] Create a feature branch per submission (e.g. `add-tradeclaw`)
- [ ] Verify demo URL is live: https://tradeclaw.win
- [ ] Verify GitHub repo is public: https://github.com/naimkatiman/tradeclaw
- [ ] Confirm star count (maintainers sometimes check this)

## 1. awesome-selfhosted

**Repo:** https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted
**Estimated review time:** 2–6 weeks
**Priority:** HIGH (200k+ stars, massive discovery impact)

### Steps

- [ ] Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) carefully
- [ ] Find alphabetical position under `Money, Budgeting & Management`
- [ ] Add entry (copy from `awesome-selfhosted.md`):

### Common rejection reasons to avoid

- Description starts with "A" or "An" — ours doesn't ✓
- Description over 250 characters — check ✓
- Missing demo URL — we have https://tradeclaw.win ✓
- Wrong license tag — use `MIT` ✓
- Not truly self-hostable — Docker Compose, no required cloud ✓
