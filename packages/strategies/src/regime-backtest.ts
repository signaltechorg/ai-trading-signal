/**
 * Phase 4 — D5: Regime-conditioned backtest mode + per-regime metrics.
 *
 * This module lets a backtest evaluate an entry strategy's edge CONDITIONED ON
 * the market regime at each entry bar, producing per-regime cost-adjusted
 * metrics. It is the machinery C6 runs to generate the per-regime gate evidence.
 *
 * Why not just backtest the presets: the runner window-caps `hmm-top3` and
 * `full-risk` (top-3-by-window → ~3 trades / 2y), so those presets measure
 * nothing over a long run. Per-regime evaluation therefore drives ENTRY MODULES
 * directly (classic, vwap-ema-bb), conditioned on regime, never the capped
 * presets.
 *
 * Reuse, not reimplementation:
 *   - `classifyRegime` (@tradeclaw/signals) — the SAME structural HMM classifier
 *     regime-aware.ts uses; called with the SAME `(symbol, window)` signature.
 *   - `passesTrendFilter` (./router, Phase 4 C2/D2) — the single shared trend
 *     predicate, fed a bounded trailing slice per the C2 performance note.
 *   - `runBacktest` + its cost/geometry options (./run-backtest) — UNCHANGED.
 *
 * Conditioning vs. regime-aware FILTERING — the deliberate divergence:
 *   regime-aware.ts is PERMISSIVE: a too-short window or a classifier throw
 *   FAILS OPEN (the signal passes). Here, conditioning is EXCLUSIVE: a signal is
 *   kept ONLY when its entry-bar regime is provably === the target. A too-short
 *   window or a classifier throw means "cannot confirm regime == target", so the
 *   signal is DROPPED (conservative), NOT passed. This is the correct semantics
 *   for bucketing evidence: an unverifiable bar must not leak into a regime
 *   bucket it may not belong to.

/**
 * Trailing-window size handed to the classifier and trend filter at each signal
 * bar — NOT the full growing history (that would make a C6 run O(n²)).
 *
 * Why 329, derived from the BINDING constraint (atrPercentile saturation):
 *   The classifier decodes over the LAST DEFAULT_SEQUENCE_LENGTH = 64 feature
 *   vectors. The FIRST of those vectors sits at bar W−64 of a W-bar window. Its
 *   atrPercentile feature ranks ATR(14)/close samples accumulated up to that
 *   bar: there are (W−64) − atrPeriod + 1 = W − 64 − 14 + 1 = W − 77 such
 *   samples. atrPercentile ranks over atrPercentileWindow = 252 samples, so for
 *   that earliest Viterbi bar to see a FULLY SATURATED percentile (matching the
 *   live writer, RECENT_BARS = 400, which is saturated) we need:
 *
 *       W − 77 ≥ 252   →   W ≥ 329.
 *
 *   At W = 160 the earliest Viterbi bar ranks over only 160 − 77 = 83 samples,
 *   so its atrPercentile diverges from the live writer at percentile boundaries
 *   — which would corrupt C6's per-regime bucketing. 329 closes that gap.
 *
 * The other two needs are already satisfied (329 ≫ both):
 *   - Feature warmup floor: atrPeriod 14 + MIN_ATR_PERCENTILE_SAMPLES 30 − 1 = 43
 *     bars before the first non-null vector, plus 64 vectors = 107-bar floor to
 *     fill the Viterbi window at all. 329 > 107.
 *   - passesTrendFilter needs max(emaPeriod 50 + slopeLookback 3, adxPeriod 14 + 1)
 *     = 53 bars. 329 > 53.
 *
 * Perf is irrelevant: each per-signal classify/filter call is O(329), a bounded
 * slice — never O(history), so a C6 run stays far below O(bars²).
 *
 * The window is the trailing 329 bars ENDING AT the signal bar (inclusive), so
 * classification/filtering see exactly the data available up to entry — no
 * lookahead.
