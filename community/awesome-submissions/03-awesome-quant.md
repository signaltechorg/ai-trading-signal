### Features relevant to quant audience

- **Signal engine:** RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands (squeeze + width), EMA cross (9/21/50/200 MA), ATR volatility, price-vs-VWAP
- **Backtesting:** Win rate, Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, total return
- **Multi-asset:** 12+ symbols — EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDJPY, BTC, ETH, XAUUSD, etc.
- **API:** REST API with OpenAPI 3.0 spec — scriptable, CI-friendly
- **Self-hosted:** Full Docker Compose stack (Next.js app + TimescaleDB + Redis)
- **Notifications:** Telegram + Discord webhooks for signal push

### Why it fits awesome-quant

awesome-quant already lists backtesting libraries and data tools. TradeClaw adds
a full-stack, self-hosted *platform* layer — rare in the open-source quant space.
Most comparable tools are either cloud-only (TradingView, Coinigy) or purely
Python libraries without a UI.

## Notes for submitter

- If the maintainer prefers a different section (e.g., "Frameworks"), the entry text is identical
- The project uses TypeScript/Node.js — not Python — which may be noted; it complements existing Python tools as a UI/dashboard layer
