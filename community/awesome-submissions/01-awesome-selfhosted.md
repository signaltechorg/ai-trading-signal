# Submission: awesome-selfhosted

> SUPERSEDED (2026-06-02): verified live status is in `docs/awesome-lists/SUBMISSION_STATUS.md`. This draft is wrong — awesome-selfhosted is submitted as a YAML file in the `awesome-selfhosted-data` repo (not a README line), and the project is on HOLD until ~2026-07-25 (4-month-age rule). Use `community/awesome-submissions/tradeclaw.yml`. Do not submit from this file.
